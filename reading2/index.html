            <h4>1. <br>What is the thesis of this article?<br>
                The article draws from a talk that was delivered on November 14, 2013, at Build in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The author explores the evolution of the computerized world and screen-based design while examining ideas on digital canvases.
                
                In the opening paragraph, the author compares the development of digital screens to aspirin pills and makes comparisons between the history of computer technology. It makes the case that displays are now the central component of computers, emphasizing the significance of interface design.
                
                The author also stresses that design is about controlling the changes on screens, stating that screens are an adaptable medium with limitless possibilities. For designers to communicate effectively, it is considered essential to develop a language of transformation.
                
                Furthermore, the essay raises issues regarding the condition of the web today and argues that a new roadmap is necessary.  It discusses how technology influences us and the importance of aligning it with our goals.
                
                In the end, the piece emphasizes how screen evolution and societal change are interconnected while offering hope that we may still affect what we have made.
                
                <br><br> 2. <br>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? <br>
                
                Based on the examples, the two ideological camps are vastly different. Flat design uses a flat visual style to eliminate the relationship with the 3D world, emphasizing simplicity and clarity. Although the user experience is improved by this simplicity, the visual meaning may be weak.  Conversely, Skeuomorph design emphasizes imitating the tangible characteristics of the real world, utilizing recognizable forms and shapes to facilitate user comprehension of interfaces. However, this approach can sometimes introduce unnecessary complexity and confuse users. Personally, I would choose to combine the two approaches equally because they are so dissimilar from one another. I would utilize a flat design when speedy user experience and minimalism are required. On the other hand, I would utilize Skeuomorph design if it is necessary to make use of consumers' familiarity with real-world objects and experiences, such as a garbage can. To discover a suitable design solution, it is better to combine the two approaches, as each has advantages and disadvantages of its own.
                
                <br><br> 3.<br> What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? <br>Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
                
                The zoopraxiscope is a 19th-century development by Eadweard Muybridge that produces moving images by sequentially displaying quickly-taken images. When filmmaking was still in its early days, this technology was employed to display moving pictures like a racing horse.
                
                The relevance of the zoopraxiscope to web and interaction design lies mainly in its association with moving images and time. It was used to produce moving graphics, which is analogous to how dynamic effects and animations affect the flow of the user experience in web design.
                
                One scene from classic Disney films reminds me of the zoopraxiscope. Scenes were drawn by hand, without the use of photographs, and over time, the backgrounds, gestures, and facial expressions of the characters were altered a little.  For example, multiple frames are generated in a scene where Mickey Mouse is sailing a boat and has to fast-turn the handle because of heavy winds. These frames are quickly cycled through to give the spectator a sense of urgency and power. Furthermore, in the earlier days of taxi drives, meter machines in Korea and Japan used to show running horses alongside the fare amount. The horse seemed to run faster when the taxi drove quickly and to trot more slowly when it drove slowly. Also, I believe this is user experience design. Web interfaces may include instances of user experience design, including the fast/slow movements of symbols that represent download speeds during file downloads from the internet. These examples, in my opinion, demonstrate the concepts that the zoopraxiscope has used in the past and show how some features have changed from early screen systems to modern via web design.</h4>
