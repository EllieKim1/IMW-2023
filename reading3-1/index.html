                Why does Laurel SchwulstLinks to an external site. advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.<br>
                In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website.

            <h4>1.<br>

                The main reason Laurel Schwulst favours individual websites over social media is the control they provide consumers. She points out the agency and independence people have when creating their websites, distinguishing this from the limitations and for-profit interests that are common on social networking platforms. Schwulst critiques social media for emphasizing marketing and corporate agendas over user demands, resulting in a need for more authentic self-expression and fulfillment for users. She sees personal websites as places for people to really express themselves without being constrained by social media algorithms and interfaces.

                I partially agree with Schwulst's viewpoint. The thought of having complete control over one's online appearance and being able to express oneself without interference from advertisements and corporate interests is appealing. Personal websites indeed offer endless creative possibilities and allow users to shape their digital identities authentically. However, I appreciate the practical difficulties connected with maintaining personal web pages, particularly for people with limited technological knowledge. Many users prefer social media platforms for self-expression because of their easy-to-use interfaces and ubiquitous accessibility.

                To summarize, while I appreciate Schwulst's support for individual websites and see their potential for true self-expression, I feel that for many people, the convenience and accessibility of social media platforms are still preferred for online self-expression.

                2.<br> I compare a website to a "diary." A journal provides a platform for users to write about their everyday events and thoughts, allowing them to record and share their feelings and ideas. Similarly, a website can be compared to a digital diary, in which people record their stories and ideas. It provides people with a personal space to express their creative ideas and passions. Thus, a website is a vital area for people to express their online presence and thoughts, with unlimited possibilities within its digital pages.
